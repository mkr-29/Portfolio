            I am a front-end web developer, I have completed numerous projects
            and Iâ€™m currently expanding my skills to include back-end
            development using Flask and Django. I have also done UI/UX designing
            too and have made a few projects in that too.
            <br /><br/>
            Till now in the field of front end web development I have learnt
            HTML, CSS, JS and also JSX used in JS front end frame work library
            named React. Almost all my projects have been made using React. The
            passion for web development and eagerness to learn new technologies
            has led me to explore the world of back-end development. I am
            currently learning Flask, a micro web framework in Python, and plan
            to expand my knowledge to Django, a powerful web framework, in the
            near future.
